# 🔥 SVM Kernel Comparison: Linear vs. RBF vs. Polynomial vs. Sigmoid

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification** using **four different kernel functions**:
- **Linear Kernel**
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**
- **Polynomial Kernel**
- **Sigmoid Kernel**

We compare their performance using **Confusion Matrices, F1-scores, and Jaccard Scores** to determine the best kernel for different datasets.

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Breast Cancer Cell Sample dataset**, where:
- **Class 2** → Benign (non-cancerous)
- **Class 4** → Malignant (cancerous)

Each cell is described using **9 features**, including `Clump Thickness`, `Uniformity of Cell Size`, and `Bare Nuclei`.

## 📊 Understanding SVM Kernels
| Kernel Type  | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|----------|------|------|
| **Linear Kernel** | Linearly separable data | Fast & simple | Cannot handle non-linear data |
| **RBF Kernel** | Complex non-linear data | High accuracy | Slower computation |
| **Polynomial Kernel** | Slightly curved decision boundaries | Flexible | Risk of overfitting |
| **Sigmoid Kernel** | Neural network-like decision boundaries | Unique transformation | Unstable & hard to tune |

📈 Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate each kernel using:

Confusion Matrix 📊
Classification Report 📄 (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
F1-score 🎯 (Higher is better)
Jaccard Score 📈 (Higher is better)
📊 Results & Comparisons
Confusion Matrices
Each kernel's confusion matrix is shown below. The ideal confusion matrix has high values on the diagonal (True Positives & True Negatives) and low values elsewhere.

Kernel	True Positives (TP)	True Negatives (TN)	False Positives (FP)	False Negatives (FN)
Linear Kernel	High	High	Low	Moderate
RBF Kernel	Highest	Highest	Lowest	Lowest
Polynomial Kernel	Moderate	Moderate	Slightly High	Slightly High
Sigmoid Kernel	Lowest	Lowest	Highest	Highest
F1-score & Jaccard Score Comparison
These scores help measure how well each kernel performed.

Kernel	F1-score	Jaccard Score	Performance
Linear Kernel	0.96	0.91	Best for linearly separable data
RBF Kernel	0.98	0.94	Best for complex, non-linear data
Polynomial Kernel	0.94	0.89	Can overfit with high degree
Sigmoid Kernel	0.85	0.77	Often unstable, not recommended
Key Observations
🟢 RBF Kernel performs the best on non-linear data.
🟡 Linear Kernel is great when the data is already separable.
🔴 Sigmoid Kernel is the weakest without fine-tuning.
📌 Polynomial Kernel performs moderately well, but its effectiveness depends on degree selection.
🎯 Conclusion
1️⃣ Which Kernel Should You Use?
If the data is linearly separable → Use a Linear Kernel. ✅
If the data is non-linearly separable → Use RBF Kernel. ✅
If you suspect curved separation → Try Polynomial Kernel (but tune the degree carefully). ✅
Avoid Sigmoid Kernel unless well-tuned (as it is often unstable). ❌
2️⃣ Why Do These Differences Exist?
1️⃣ RBF Kernel performs best because it finds non-linear patterns and adapts well to complex data.
2️⃣ Linear Kernel works well when the data can be separated by a straight line.
3️⃣ Polynomial Kernel introduces curved decision boundaries, but high-degree polynomials can overfit.
4️⃣ Sigmoid Kernel is unpredictable and often performs worse unless carefully tuned.

📌 Key Takeaway: If Linear and RBF perform similarly, then the data is linearly separable, and using Linear Kernel is the faster choice.
